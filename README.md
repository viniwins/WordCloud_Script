# WordCloud_Script

using this script we can create a "word cloud" from a text, uploaded by the user.  This program will process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words. It is a part of the python course taught by Google on Coursera.
